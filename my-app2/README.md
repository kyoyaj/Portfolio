Sample single page app for Troops.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Dependencies 

For Typeahead (since I figured it was already out there so why bother writing something from scratch)

npm install --save react-bootstrap-typeahead

Other than Typeahead I didn't really use anything else (I think)

## Side Notes

- I didn't implement Redux since this is my very first React app, I figure I need more time to read up on Redux. Also, I will be away from home starting April 10 so I won't have a chance to look at this until end of April (once I'm back from overseas trip)

- I used Typeahead and there's probably some more styling I need to do on top of it

- Image of careers panel wil change once you register

- Added 'Full Name' field on register panel

- Oceandriver api is broken :/ You can see for yourself in their api page
